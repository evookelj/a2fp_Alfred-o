Wrote initial draft of plan (outline),

Began classes TileNode and Mahjong (before quickly realizing much more
diagramming is to be done about how different Objects are interacting
before code can be started.

Begin Board class and tweak TileNode. Also write primitive, basic,
grossly-structured graphical methods to see/show what is going on.

Added comments to Board and TileNode classes so that very nuanced variables
would make sense to all involved (ergo making the code more processible).

EV
Implemented tile selection and removal with conditions that both are on top,
not surrounded, and are of the same color.

Made it so tile can't be selected with itself. Also allowed de-selection of
a tile (by clicking it twice).

EV
Add pics to data for tile design

EV, Busy B, JD
Start incorporating tile designs into game (and try to debug)
